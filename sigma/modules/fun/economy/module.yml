    description:
      Gives an amount of kud to you with a 22 hour cooldown.
      The amount is modified by the number of days in a row that you've collected
      your daily Kud up to 10 days, as well as a little random factor in there just for fun.
      While the Kud can be collected each 22h, the streak is reset 48h after the last one was collected.
