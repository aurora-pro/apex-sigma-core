description:
  The Blink Walker is a lean creature standing at a towering 10 feet tall with curling horns jutting from its head.
  As it stands in one place watching you, you see it vibrate rapidly, almost as if it's phasing in and out of existence.
  Though they are blind, the blink walker usually follows its victims, acknowledging from a distance.
  If the creature it is following veers off the dirt path and into the forest, the Blink Walker quickly strikes.
