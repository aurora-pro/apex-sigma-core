description:
  The Garthim are huge, tentacled, black-carapaced flea-like creatures, armed with powerful claws and moved with a loud ticking sound.
  The Garthim were also immensely powerful, easily able to smash through stone walls and destroy anything regardless of its construction.
  When not in battle, they stood like sentries in the corridors and pits of The Castle of the Crystal, standing immobile until given a command.
