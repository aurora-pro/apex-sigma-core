description:
  A Stinkhorn is more combat able than most members of it's circle and is often looked upon for a guardian role.
  Stinkhorns will often distract attackers, allowing the colony the ability to flee first.
  Few attackers chase a Stinkhorn due to poisonous spores left in its wake.
  Stinkhorns are only usually found in larger colonies, as they are rarer than the average myconid, and a colony with Stinkhorns tends to prosper and grow.
