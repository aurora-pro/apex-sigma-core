description:
  Let’s face it (pun intended),
  this little guy didn’t take a whole lot of imagination to name,
  "Dracula" because of its two long,
  fang-like petals and "simia" for its resemblance to primates.
  The two dark little eyes, fuzzy dotted eyebrows,
  and furry little nose and beard area bear striking simian similarities
  that become even more apparent when viewed from a distance.
