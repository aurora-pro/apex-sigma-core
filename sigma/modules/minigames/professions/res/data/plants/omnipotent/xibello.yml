description:
  This strangely named plant from the Tulip family is one of the rarest
  living things that we currently know of. Its leaves have a light blue
  line running along one side of the leaf that glows in pulses.
  It's been noticed that the color can change just slightly. The reason
  is however unknown.
  They contain Quartz in their stems and are like batteries of the plant world.
